### **Steps to Complete the Project**

#### **1. Environment Setup**

---

##### **Step 1.1: Create a Simulated Network**

1. **Set Up Virtual Machines (VMs)**:
   - Use a virtualization tool like **Hyper-V**, **VMware**, or **VirtualBox** to create multiple VMs.
   - Choose various operating systems for each VM (e.g., Windows 10/11, Linux) to simulate different environments. This diversity allows testing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on different platforms.

2. **Configure Networking**:
   - Ensure that these VMs can communicate with each other by setting them up in the same virtual network or subnet. This can be done within the virtualization tool’s network configuration.
   - If using Azure or an on-premises Active Directory (AD), join the VMs to the respective directory. This step enables centralized management and easier integration of Microsoft Defender.

   **Example**:
   - Windows VMs can be joined to Azure Active Directory or your on-premises Active Directory to enable access to group policies, security settings, and centralized threat detection.

##### **Step 1.2: Install Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**

1. **Access the Microsoft 365 Defender Portal**:
   - Log into the **Microsoft 365 Defender portal** at [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com).
   - Ensure you have the necessary licenses to use Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. You may need an **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** or **Microsoft 365 E5 license**.

2. **Assign Defender for Endpoint Licenses**:
   - Assign the **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** license to the users or VMs you want to protect. This can be done via the Microsoft 365 Admin Center by selecting the specific users and assigning the appropriate security licenses.

3. **Onboard Each VM**:
   - Onboard the VMs to **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** by running an onboarding script that configures the Defender for Endpoint software on each VM. This script enables Defender’s security features and establishes communication between each VM and the Defender portal.

   **To onboard a Windows VM**:
   - Download the onboarding script from the Microsoft Defender portal:
     ```bash
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/mdm_download_link -OutFile "DefenderForEndpointOnboardingScript.ps1"
     ```
   - **Run the Script**:
     - Execute the downloaded PowerShell script on the VM to install and configure the Defender for Endpoint client.
     - This script connects the VM to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint service, enabling threat detection and security monitoring.

   **Example command**:
   ```bash
   # PowerShell command to onboard the VM
   .\DefenderForEndpointOnboardingScript.ps1
   ```

4. **Verify Onboarding**:
   - Once the script has been executed, the VM will be registered with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and you can monitor its security status from the Defender portal.

5. **Repeat** for all VMs:
   - Run the onboarding process on all virtual machines in the simulated environment to ensure they are fully protected and monitored by Microsoft Defender.


### **2. Configure Endpoint Security Policies**

---

#### **Step 2.1: Set Up Antivirus and Malware Protection**

1. **Configure Antivirus Settings in Microsoft Defender**:
   - **Real-Time Protection**:
     - Enable **real-time protection** in Microsoft Defender to automatically detect and block malware as it runs on your systems. This feature helps prevent the execution of harmful files by actively scanning processes, files, and scripts.
   - **Scheduled Scans**:
     - Set up periodic scans to ensure your system remains protected even when real-time protection is not active. Schedule scans during low-usage hours to minimize impact on performance.
     - In the **Microsoft 365 Defender portal**, go to **Endpoint Security** > **Antivirus** > **Settings**, and configure the **Full Scan** and **Quick Scan** schedules.

   **Example**:
   - You can configure a **daily quick scan** and a **weekly full scan** for all VMs in the environment.

2. **Enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) Rules**:
   - ASR rules are preconfigured rules that block certain activities often used in attacks, such as phishing attempts, credential theft, or attempts to run malicious scripts.
   - To enable ASR rules:
     1. Go to **Microsoft 365 Defender portal** > **Endpoint Security** > **Attack Surface Reduction**.
     2. Enable rules like **Block credential stealing** or **Block phishing** to mitigate common attack vectors.
     3. You can also create custom rules to target specific threats or vulnerabilities.
   
   **Example**:
   - Enable the **Phishing Protection** rule, which blocks emails and links commonly associated with phishing attacks.

3. **Configure Additional Malware Protection**:
   - In addition to real-time protection and ASR rules, ensure that **cloud-delivered protection** is enabled for up-to-date protection against the latest threats.
   - Enable **Automatic Sample Submission** so that suspicious files are sent to Microsoft for analysis, ensuring ongoing improvements to malware detection.

#### **Step 2.2: Enable Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**

1. **Enable EDR Features**:
   - **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** provides deeper visibility into suspicious activities on endpoints, allowing you to investigate and respond to threats efficiently.
   - To enable EDR, go to **Microsoft 365 Defender portal** > **Endpoint Security** > **EDR Settings**.
   - Under the **EDR policy**, set it to **Monitor mode** for detection only, or **Block mode** for both detection and automatic response to threats.

2. **Configure EDR for Automatic Investigation and Response**:
   - EDR can automatically detect unusual activities like process anomalies, file modifications, and suspicious network connections. Configure it to trigger **automatic investigation** whenever such activities are detected.
   - Enable **automated remediation** so that Microsoft Defender can automatically take action when a threat is detected, such as isolating an infected device or quarantining a file.

   **Example Actions**:
   - **Isolate the affected device**: When an endpoint is compromised, Defender can isolate it from the network to prevent the threat from spreading.
   - **Quarantine malicious files**: Suspicious or malicious files can be automatically moved to quarantine, preventing further damage while allowing for analysis.

3. **Set Alerts and Notifications**:
   - Configure alerts for activities detected by EDR, such as malware execution or unusual network behavior. Alerts should be routed to the appropriate response team or security personnel.
   - In the **Microsoft 365 Defender portal**, configure your notification settings under **Alerts** to ensure timely responses to detected threats.

4. **Enable Threat Hunting**:
   - For advanced detection, enable **Threat Hunting** within EDR. This feature allows you to proactively search for signs of compromise and investigate suspicious patterns across your network.
   - You can search for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and track suspicious activity across endpoints in real time.

By configuring **Antivirus** settings, **Attack Surface Reduction rules**, and enabling **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**, you ensure that your virtual machines are well-protected against both known and unknown threats. Additionally, you enable the system to automatically detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents, minimizing the potential damage of security breaches.

### **3. Perform Vulnerability Assessments**

     - **Risk levels**: Vulnerabilities are categorized by severity (low, medium, high).
     - **Affected devices and applications**: Identify which VMs or software are vulnerable.
     - **Suggested actions**: Defender recommends steps to mitigate risks, such as installing updates or reconfiguring system settings.

2. **Address High-Severity Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Apply Patches**: Install updates or patches for high-risk vulnerabilities. This can often be automated through Microsoft Endpoint Manager or other patch management tools.
   - **Restrict Risky Applications or Files**:
     - Disable or remove outdated or vulnerable software from affected VMs.
     - Block risky files using Defender’s **File Block** or **Application Control policies**.

3. **Document Findings and Actions**:
   - Maintain a log of vulnerabilities identified, their severity, and the mitigation steps taken.
   - Update your **vulnerability assessment report** to reflect the current status and resolved issues.

### **Step 4: Simulate and Detect Threats**

#### **Step 4.1: Simulate Threats (Optional)**

1. **Create a Test Threat**:
   - Use a safe malware testing tool like the **EICAR test file** to simulate malware.  
   - Run the following command on a test endpoint to create a harmless test file:
     ```bash
     echo "X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*" > C:\Test\eicar.com
     ```

2. **Simulate Phishing Attacks**:
   - Send a controlled phishing email to a test mailbox in your environment.

3. **Simulate Suspicious Processes**:
   - Use tools like **Sysinternals** to create benign but unusual process behavior.
